# Gas Frontend

This project is the the face of [GasAdvisor](https://www.gasadvisor.it). It contains what users see when they land on
the page. It is backed by a [Backend](https://github.com/DieCi007/gasadvisor_backend) built with Spring Boot/Kotlin and by an [Admin Site](https://github.com/DieCi007/gas-console) that can help with day to
day management.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.1.4.
